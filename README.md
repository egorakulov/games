# GAMES

My name is Egor Akulov and these are the games that I build in my spare time! 
I am very interested in game development, especially of 2D platformers and of top-down 2D games (think Pokemon or old 90s style RPGs). 
I am working on my skills so that one day I can develop a full fledged game and hopefully release it to Steam. 
I also want to attempt to create my own personal 3D rendering engine. 
Basically, I am experimenting with game development and seeing where it takes me. 

I want to build these games in a variety of languages, but as of right now I am only sticking to java. 

## My Current Project

#### 2D Platformer

I am currently following a Youtube tutorial on how to build a 2D platformer. After I finish this tutorial I will take what I apply and build my own.

## Games Built so Far

#### Game of Life

Tech stack: Java

Conaly's Game of Life, complete with an intro screen explaining the rules and a controls screen that tells you how to operate the program.
Can reset the simulation, stop it, and navigate between screens. 
Spent way too long playing around in it creating cool patterns and seeing what happens. :)

#### Pong

Tech stack: Java

A replica of the classic Pong game. 
Requires two players. 
Complete with an introductory screen that explains rules and how to operate the program, and a game over screen where the user can press y to play again. 
Runs at 60 frames per second.  

#### Snake

Tech Stack: Java

A snake clone that allows the user to press y to restart after they have died, without every leaving the program.
