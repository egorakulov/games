# GAMES

My name is Egor Akulov and these are the games that I build in my spare time! I am very interested in game development, especially of 2D platformers and of top-down 2D games (think Pokemon or old 90s style RPGs). I am working on my skills so that one day I can develop a full fledged game that is one of these two. I also want to attempt to create my own personal 3D rendering engine. Basically, I am just experimenting with game development and seeing where it takes me. 

I want to build these games in a variety of languages, but as of right now I am only sticking to java. 

## Games Built so Far

#### Snake

Built using Java, a snake clone that allows the user to press y to restart after they have died, without every leaving the program. 

#### Pong

Currently building in Java, a full replica of the classic 2-player Pong game. 

## My Next Project

#### Game of Life

I want to build the Game of Life, in Java, Python, C++, and Typescript. I want to have a window where you can zoom in and out, look at different parts of the map, etc.
