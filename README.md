# GAMES

My name is Egor Akulov and these are the games that I build in my spare time! 
I am very interested in game development, especially of 2D platformers and of top-down 2D games (think Pokemon or old 90s style RPGs). 
I am working on my skills so that one day I can develop a full fledged game and hopefully release it to Steam. 
I also want to attempt to create my own personal 3D rendering engine. 
Basically, I am experimenting with game development and seeing where it takes me. 

I want to build these games in a variety of languages, but as of right now I am only sticking to java. 

## My Current Project

As of right now I am between projects! 
I think the next one I do will be a platformer, but I have not finished figuring out what exactly it will be. 
I am thinking of trying to have a bigger sprite (maybe 32 bits, maybe 64) and a more fleshed out map. 
It will be a simple platformer though, just kind of jumping between things. Mostly for me to learn more. 


## Games Built so Far

#### Dress the Penguin

Tech Stack: Java

There are 6 different islands on the map: the one you start on, and 5 more to explore. 
Hidden randomly on the map (on the islands) are boots, mittens, and a hat.
The goal of the game is to have your penguin put on the boots, mittens, and hat and get the cold coin that is somewhere on the map.
To travel between islands, you can place logs in the water. You can also pick up logs that are in the water.
All as fast as you can!

I am very proud of this project. I had watched a Youtube tutorial that taught me the basics of top down 2D game development such as collision detection and how to draw the map.
But after that I was on my own. 
The controls are a bit finnicky, which means there is room to improve on the next project. 

Controls:

- WASD to move
- J to highlight the next square
- K to place log in water, L to pick up log from water

#### Game of Life

Tech stack: Java

Conaly's Game of Life, complete with an intro screen explaining the rules and a controls screen that tells you how to operate the program.
Can reset the simulation, stop it, and navigate between screens. 
Spent way too long playing around in it creating cool patterns and seeing what happens. :)

#### Pong

Tech stack: Java

A replica of the classic Pong game. 
Requires two players. 
Complete with an introductory screen that explains rules and how to operate the program, and a game over screen where the user can press y to play again. 
Runs at 60 frames per second.

#### Snake

Tech Stack: Java

A snake clone that allows the user to press y to restart after they have died, without every leaving the program.
